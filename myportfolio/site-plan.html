      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Jonathan Cobabe.</p>
      <p>I graduated high school in Filer, Idaho in 2021. I am now going to school at BYU-Idaho trying to learn more about computers, how they work, and how we tell them to do stuff.
        I work at the Best Buy in Twin Falls currently. I basically just unload trucks and stock shelves there. I enjoy it but holiday times get kinda crazy. Expecially around Black Friday and Christmas.
        Some of my hobbies include: football, soccer, and computer related things. This includes, coding, buiding computers, playing games with friends,
        buying random indie games and trying them out for an hour or two, and trying out mods for different games.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects Experiences Credentials</h3>
      <p>I don't have a lot of experience or credentials at the moment but I can learn fast and I like solving problems.
        One of my experiences was job shadowing an entrepreneur, Chris Ayers, in high school. Chris showed me what his day to day was being mostly hands off with his business.
        This business was The RAWR Agency. They do branding, website building, and just overall help other companies grow.
        A lot of my experience has come from doing my homework. With my assignments I learn more and more about coding and building websites.
